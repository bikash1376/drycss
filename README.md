Dry CSS is a tiny css library that doesnt use any javascript and it mimics bootstrap classes. It is not in npm registry yet but you can download the css file from dist folder and use it in your project by linking it in your html file. 

Well, why not use tailwind or bootstrap then?
Sorry, I don't have an answer to this question. I just made this for fun.
